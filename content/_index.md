Hi, Iâ€™m Eric, a 29-year-old nerd figuring out my place on this giant spinning rock we call Earth. This space is a digital garden: a mix of thoughts, experiments, and notes from the corners of my mind. Some ideas are new, others half-formed, and a few have been left behind, but all reflect my ongoing process of learning and building. The name of this site speaks to that effort: tending to this garden and shaping the life I want in the spaces between everything else.

### Explore the garden:

- ðŸŒ± [Seedlings](/seedlings/): Ideas in early growth: experiments, and curiosities.
- ðŸŒ¿ [In Bloom](/in-bloom/): Projects currently growing. Expect updates and reflections as I go.
- ðŸŒ¾ [Harvest](/harvest/): Complete guides, tools, and finished thoughts.
- ðŸª± [Compost](/compost/): Ideas Iâ€™ve let go of, and what I learned from them.
- ðŸ§ª [Lab Log](/lab-log/): Ongoing logs of what Iâ€™m building, breaking, and tweaking.

This is not a blog, but more of a living notebook. Come back anytime â€” things tend to change here.
