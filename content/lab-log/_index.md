This is my field journal — short updates, loose reflections, and notes on whatever I’m working on. Some weeks are busy, some are quiet. Sometimes it’s technical, sometimes it’s just me thinking out loud. 

It helps me keep track of where my time and energy are going, even if I don’t finish everything.
