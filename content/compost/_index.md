Not everything grows. This is where I let go of projects that stalled, ideas that didn’t quite work, or things I chose not to finish, and that’s okay. 

Each post here holds something I learned, even if the end result didn’t pan out.I want to remember *why* something didn’t work, so I can build smarter next time.
