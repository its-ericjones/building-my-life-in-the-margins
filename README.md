# Building My Life in the Margins

This is the source for my personal site — a growing digital garden built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

I wanted a space to write and document what I’ve been building, thinking about, and sometimes letting go of. Not a blog. Not a portfolio. Just a notebook that lives on the web.

## 🌱 Why I’m Doing This

I’ve been venturing into the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) movement — the quiet belief that having a small, personal site still matters. Especially in an internet full of algorithmic sludge and AI-generated content.

I don’t want to wait around for platforms to decide what I can or can’t share. And I don’t want to build a site that’s bloated with trackers or scripts.. I want something:

- Fast
- Lightweight
- Easy to read
- Easy to maintain

## 🏗️ What I'm Currently Building
- [x] Design
- [] Copying content over from previous blogging platform [Pika](https://pika.page)
- [] Provision Virtual Private Server for hosting
