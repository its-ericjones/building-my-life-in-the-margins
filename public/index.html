<p>Hi, I’m Eric, a 29-year-old nerd figuring out my place on this giant spinning rock we call Earth. This space is a digital garden: a mix of thoughts, experiments, and notes from the corners of my mind. Some ideas are new, others half-formed, and a few have been left behind, but all reflect my ongoing process of learning and building. The name of this site speaks to that effort: tending to this garden and shaping the life I want in the spaces between everything else.</p>
<h3 id="explore-the-garden">Explore the garden:</h3>

<li>🌾 <a href="/harvest/">Harvest</a>: Complete guides, tools, and finished thoughts.</li>

</ul>
<p>This is not a blog, but more of a living notebook. Come back anytime — things tend to change here.</p>
